		In October 1993, Novell, the company that owned the rights to the Unix System V source at the time, transferred the trademarks of Unix 
		to the X/Open Company (now The Open Group), and in 1995 sold the related business operations to Santa Cruz Operation (SCO). Whether 
		Novell also sold the copyrights to the actual software was the subject of a federal lawsuit in 2006, SCO v. Novell, which Novell won. 
		The case was appealed, but on August 30, 2011, the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed the trial decisions, 
		closing the case. Unix vendor SCO Group Inc. accused Novell of slander of title.<n><n>
		
		The present owner of the trademark UNIX is The Open Group, an industry standards consortium. Only systems fully compliant with and 
		certified to the Single UNIX Specification qualify as "UNIX" (others are called "Unix-like").<n><n>
		
		By decree of The Open Group, the term "UNIX" refers more to a class of operating systems than to a specific implementation of an operating 
		system; those operating systems which meet The Open Group's Single UNIX Specification should be able to bear the UNIX 98 or UNIX 03 
		trademarks today, after the operating system's vendor pays a substantial certification fee and annual trademark royalties to The Open Group. 
		Systems that have been licensed to use the UNIX trademark include AIX, EulerOS, HP-UX, Inspur K-UX, IRIX, macOS, Solaris, Tru64 UNIX 
		(formerly "Digital UNIX", or OSF/1), and z/OS. Notably, EulerOS and Inspur K-UX are Linux distributions certified as UNIX 03 compliant.<n><n>
		
		Sometimes a representation like Un*x, *NIX, or *N?X is used to indicate all operating systems similar to Unix. This comes from the use of 
		the asterisk (*) and the question mark characters as wildcard indicators in many utilities. This notation is also used to describe other 
		Unix-like systems that have not met the requirements for UNIX branding from the Open Group.<n><n>
		
		The Open Group requests that UNIX is always used as an adjective followed by a generic term such as system to help avoid the creation of a 
		genericized trademark.<n><n>
		
		Unix was the original formatting,[disputed â€“ discuss] but the usage of UNIX remains widespread because it was once typeset in small caps 
		(Unix). According to Dennis Ritchie, when presenting the original Unix paper to the third Operating Systems Symposium of the American 
		Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), "we had a new typesetter and troff had just been invented and we were intoxicated by being 
		able to produce small caps". Many of the operating system's predecessors and contemporaries used all-uppercase lettering, so many people 
		wrote the name in upper case due to force of habit. It is not an acronym.<n><n>
		
		Trademark names can be registered by different entities in different countries and trademark laws in some countries allow the same trademark 
		name to be controlled by two different entities if each entity uses the trademark in easily distinguishable categories. The result is that Unix 
		has been used as a brand name for various products including bookshelves, ink pens, bottled glue, diapers, hair driers and food containers.<n><n>
		
		Several plural forms of Unix are used casually to refer to multiple brands of Unix and Unix-like systems. Most common is the conventional 
		Unixes, but Unices, treating Unix as a Latin noun of the third declension, is also popular. The pseudo-Anglo-Saxon plural form Unixen is not 
		common, although occasionally seen. Sun Microsystems, developer of the Solaris variant, has asserted that the term Unix is itself plural, 
		referencing its many implementations.<n><n>
