		Unix is a family of multitasking, multiuser computer operating systems that derive from the original AT&T Unix, 
		development starting in the 1970s at the Bell Labs research center by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others.<n><n>
		Initially intended for use inside the Bell System, AT&T licensed Unix to outside parties in the late 1970s, leading 
		to a variety of both academic and commercial Unix variants from vendors including University of California, Berkeley 
		(BSD), Microsoft (Xenix), Sun Microsystems (SunOS/Solaris), HP/HPE (HP-UX), and IBM (AIX). In the early 1990s, AT&T 
		sold its rights in Unix to Novell, which then sold its Unix business to the Santa Cruz Operation (SCO) in 1995. 
		The UNIX trademark passed to The Open Group, a neutral industry consortium founded in 1996, which allows the use of 
		the mark for certified operating systems that comply with the Single UNIX Specification (SUS). However, Novell continues 
		to own the Unix copyrights, which the SCO Group, Inc. v. Novell, Inc. court case (2010) confirmed.<n><n>
		
		Unix systems are characterized by a modular design that is sometimes called the "Unix philosophy". 
		According to this philosophy, the operating system should provide a set of simple tools, each of which performs a 
		limited, well-defined function. A unified filesystem (the Unix filesystem) and an inter-process communication mechanism 
		known as "pipes" serve as the main means of communication, and a shell scripting and command language (the Unix shell) is 
		used to combine the tools to perform complex workflows.<n><n>

		Unix distinguishes itself from its predecessors as the first portable operating system: almost the entire operating system is 
		written in the C programming language, which allows Unix to operate on numerous platforms.<n><n>
